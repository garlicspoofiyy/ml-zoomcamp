## Overview

The bootcamp is designed to provide hands-on experience with machine learning concepts and techniques. Throughout the course, I will work on various projects that involve real-world datasets and apply different machine learning algorithms to solve problems.

## Course Structure

The bootcamp is divided into several lessons, each focusing on a specific topic:

1. **Lesson 1: Introduction to Machine Learning**
   - Overview of machine learning concepts and applications.

2. **Lesson 2: Data Preparation**
   - Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.

3. **Lesson 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing and understanding data distributions and relationships.

4. **Lesson 4: Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features to improve model performance.

5. **Lesson 5: Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Training machine learning models and evaluating their performance.

6. **Lesson 6: Advanced Topics**
   - Exploring advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Flask (for web applications)

## Project Descriptions

- **Churn Prediction Project**: A project focused on predicting customer churn using classification models.
- **BTCUSD Price Prediction**: A web application that predicts the daily price movement of Bitcoin against the US Dollar using XGBoost and technical indicators.
